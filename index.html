    <p>You are Shizzly McShizzleFace, a man who sports a couple of antennae and who only wishes to moondance into a nice pool of water. It's really hot outside, you see?</p>
    <p> The thing is, in this futuristic, apocalyptic, nuclear wasted, witch cursed, global warmed world, there are a bunch of bugs moving around all like "Hey, what gives?"</p>
    <p> If you manage to reach the water 10 times, the Great Bug King, Lord McBuggyBug, will be all like "Hey McShizzleFace, we kind of respect you, bro. You know what? Feel free to rebuild society!"</p>
    <p>So go forth! You're our only hope Obi Wan! I mean McShizzleFace!</p>

      <li>Use the arrow keys (&#8592; &#8593; &#8594; &#8595;) to move the character</li>
      <li>If you touch a bug, you lose a life</li>
      <li>The goal is to reach the water without losing all lives</li>
      <li>This is a great way to learn patience while waiting to cross the street</li>

    <h2 class="message-title">YOU FAILED!</h2>
    <p>Well... this is awkward. With everyone counting on you and all...</p>
    <p>Good news, though: In theory, each time you fail, the other survivors feel less disappointed, as they expect less and less. So feel free to try.</p>
    <p>Sorry, for all that passive-aggressiveness, it's just... those bugs... they get to me!</p>

    <p>Awwww! Look at her, so cute and all, with her little crown... Pat yourself in the back, friend. You truly are the Master of Bugs!</p>
    <p>I wish that sounded a bit more heroic... :\</p>
